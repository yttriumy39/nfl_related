The total value of the salary cap is agreed between the NFL and the NFL Players association (NFLPA), the current value of the cap is 48% of the league revenue. The salary cap for the upcoming 2023 season is \\\\$224.8 million per team.\n",

There are lots of details and bits of wizardry around this that aren't clear to most fans. How NFL teams create cap space, why they create cap space and what the drawbacks of the GM's cap choices can be are not immediately obvious. In this workbook, using data from overthecap.com I am going to explain the major details of how player contracts and moving on from those contracts can affect the cap."

If a team has not either traded or agreed a contract with the player 30 days prior to the season starting, the player cannot sign that season and will need to enter the draft next season to sign with a new team (this happened with John Elway in 1983 who refused to sign for the Baltimore Colts and was drafted the year later by the Denver Broncos).\n",

In my view neither are realistic as an option for the Cardinals, meaning that if Arizona want to take a new Quarterback in 2024 they would either trade Kyler (if they can find a suitable trade partner) or would hold onto him for the 2024 season, to either trade or cut in 2025 where the cap hits involved would be much smaller."

    "Hopefully this workbook has given you a good overview of how the NFL salary cap works with regard to contracts, cuts and trades. There are many other details to the NFL's salary cap not mentioned here such as only the top 51 salaries on a team counting against the cap and there are other ways of managing contracts such as void years which I have also not gone into. Despite this, the above should give you a solid grounding in how to NFL teams manage the salary cap. You can use the cap calculator on overthecap.com to see where teams may have upcoming issues and plot how they can manage the their contracts to overcome cap challenges."
